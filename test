load suite2p 
activate suite2p before doing any analysis
python -m suite2p to have the GUI version of the suite2p (watch youtube on this topic)
To activate this new environment, run conda activate suite2p. Afterwards, You should see (suite2p) on the left side of the terminal line.

s2p_fish test command: python3 hpc_pipeline/s2p_fish_sliced.py AG_mecp2_spontaneous_20210902_fish17_2Hz_range245_step5_exposure10_power70 Spontaneous_output hpc_pipeline/ops_1P_whole.json
(the s2p_fish_sliced.py has been updated during the testing session as there is no need for half done job take over in the testing session)


warping using ANTs
make sure the fish folder name is listed as the default one where includes all parameters
module load ants/2.4.1
(after loading ants, pynrrd stopped working for some reasons. to reinstall pynrrd, use pip install git+https://github.com/mhe/pynrrd.git)

in Q4414 folder, MW is the template produced by HD stack. Zbrain is the altas with high quality. The .mat, .gz files are the mapping between the template and altas. For each future fish, only mapping between the fish and template is requried (registeration). A transformation is after by following the established pathway. 

check Gille's github for more information

Matlab - post pipeline analysis
analysis folder:
DeltaF2.m (normalisation, very slow. Might be improvable)
getBrainRegion.m (use data from the ANTs outputs)
data_loading folder (standard format are the onces with automatically computational built in):
single fish/all fish
Autism folder:
linear regression and other post pipeline studies.
loadmp2 - index the df data of certain genotype fish based on the types/name/index...
